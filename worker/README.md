# claude-warmup worker

Cloudflare Worker that opens Claude Code's 5-hour rate-limit window at
predictable times of day. Calls `api.anthropic.com` directly — no Vercel
function in the loop.

## How it decides to ping

A warm-up only opens a new window if the previous one has already expired. A
ping that lands inside an open window is silently wasted — and because a late
ping pushes the boundary later, one delay can swallow the *next* scheduled ping
too, cascading through the day. A fixed cron cannot see any of this.

So the cron ticks every 10 minutes and the Worker decides:

```
if no TARGETS_LOCAL slot in the last CATCHUP_HORIZON_MINUTES  -> skip
if this slot was already served                             -> skip
if the stored window reset time hasn't passed yet           -> skip, retry next tick
otherwise                                                   -> ping, store the new reset
```

The reset time is read from `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-reset` on every
response, so the schedule re-anchors to the real boundary on each ping instead
of extrapolating. A late trigger costs minutes, not a window.

There is no cheap way to *check* the window: reading the header requires a
request, and a request opens a window if none is open. Hence the KV state — the
Worker remembers rather than polls. Skipped ticks cost one KV read and no API
call.

Note that 24 isn't divisible by 5. The default targets give four windows a day
with a deliberate ~9h gap overnight, in exchange for boundaries that stay put.

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # runs the suite once
npm run test:watch    # reruns on save
npm run test:coverage # runs with the 100% coverage gate enforced
npm run typecheck     # src/ and test/ separately, since they use different type roots
```

Tests run inside the real Workers runtime via `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`
(so `Intl`-based DST arithmetic and KV behave exactly as in production), against
`wrangler.test.toml` — a test-only config, never used for `wrangler deploy`.
No test ever makes a real call to `api.anthropic.com`: a global `fetch` guard in
`test/setup.ts` throws if one slips through, and the retry/ping logic is
exercised via injected `fetchImpl`/`sleep`/`now` seams instead. See
[`docs/TEST_PLAN.md`](docs/TEST_PLAN.md) for the full case matrix and rationale.
CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs `typecheck` and `test:coverage` on every
push and PR.

## Setup

```bash
cd worker
npm install
npx wrangler login

# The only required secret. Generate with `claude setup-token`.
npx wrangler secret put CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN

# Create the state store, then paste the printed id into wrangler.toml
# (it replaces id = "REPLACE_ME").
npx wrangler kv namespace create WARMUP_STATE

npm run deploy
```

Before that last step, also edit `wrangler.toml`:

- `TARGET_TIMEZONE` — set to your own IANA zone (e.g. `America/New_York`), so `TARGETS_LOCAL` is read in your local time rather than the `UTC` default.
- `TARGETS_LOCAL` — adjust the target wall-clock times if the defaults (`06:00,11:00,16:00,21:00`) don't fit your schedule.

## Verifying it works

The Worker has no public route (`workers_dev = false`), so verification goes
through logs rather than HTTP:

```bash
npm run tail        # live ticks as they fire
```

Every 10 minutes you should see a `run.skipped` (usually `no-target`), and at
each `TARGETS_LOCAL` slot a `run.success`. Past runs are also browsable in the
Workers Logs dashboard, since `[observability]` is enabled — that's the record
to check the morning after, when `tail` wasn't running.

To exercise the ping path without waiting for a slot, run it locally against
the real API:

```bash
printf 'CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=<token>\nDEBUG_TRIGGER_SECRET=local\n' > .dev.vars
npx wrangler dev --test-scheduled

# in another shell — fires the cron path
curl "http://localhost:8799/cdn-cgi/handler/scheduled?cron=*/10+*+*+*+*"

# or the gating logic on demand, with ?force=1 to bypass it
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8799/run" -H "Authorization: Bearer local"
```

`.dev.vars` is gitignored. Local `wrangler dev` uses its own KV store under
`.wrangler/`, so this never touches production state.

If you do want `/health` and `/run` reachable in production, set
`workers_dev = true`, redeploy, and set `DEBUG_TRIGGER_SECRET` — without that
secret `/run` stays disabled (403), and `/health` is unauthenticated, so it
exposes your target times and window state to anyone who guesses the URL.

## What gets logged

One JSON line per event. The `run.success` / `run.failure` summary carries:

| Field | Why it's there |
|---|---|
| `runId` | Correlates the attempt lines with the summary |
| `scheduledAt` | When the cron was **due** |
| `startedAt` | When the Worker **actually** ran |
| `driftMs` | The gap between those two — the GitHub Actions problem, now measured |
| `finishedAt` / `totalMs` | Wall-clock cost of the whole run |
| `url` / `model` | Exactly what was hit |
| `tokenFingerprint` | `len=… …abcd`, to confirm *which* token is deployed |
| `attempts[]` | Per-try status, duration, and error body |
| `attempts[].headers` | Anthropic's `request-id` and `anthropic-ratelimit-*` state |
| `attempts[].usage` | Token counts from the response |
| `reply` | What Claude actually said |
| `targetSlot` / `minutesSinceTarget` | Which slot this tick was serving, and how late |
| `knownResetAt` / `minutesUntilReset` | The window boundary the Worker is gating on |
| `newResetAt` / `newResetSource` | Boundary after the ping; `header` or `fallback:+5h` |
| `rateLimit` | Full `anthropic-ratelimit-*` set, incl. 5h/7d utilization |
| `reason` (on `run.skipped`) | `no-target`, `already-served`, `window-still-open` |

A `no-target` line carries no window fields at all — that decision is made from
the clock before KV is read, so those ticks cost no storage read either.

Useful queries once it's running:

```
event = "run.failure"                 # every failed run
event = "run.skipped" AND reason = "window-still-open"
                                      # gating did its job; a fixed cron would
                                      # have wasted this slot
minutesSinceTarget > 30               # slots being served late
newResetSource = "fallback:+5h"       # the reset header stopped being sent
```

Watch `rateLimit["anthropic-ratelimit-unified-7d-utilization"]` too — it's how
you'd notice the warmups eating into the weekly budget.

Set `VERBOSE = "false"` in `wrangler.toml` to drop the per-attempt lines and
keep just the summary, once you're confident it works.

## Schedule

`crons = ["*/10 * * * *"]` — ticks every 10 minutes; the Worker gates the
actual pings. Change *when* windows open via `TARGETS_LOCAL` in `wrangler.toml`
(default `06:00,11:00,16:00,21:00`), not via the cron. `TARGETS_LOCAL` is
interpreted in `TARGET_TIMEZONE` (default `Europe/Dublin`); the Worker resolves
each target's UTC offset per day via `Intl`, so it tracks DST automatically —
no manual adjustment when the clocks change.

`CATCHUP_HORIZON_MINUTES` (default 240) is how long after a target the Worker
keeps retrying if the previous window is still open. Keep it below the gap
between targets.
